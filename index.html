            <p class="para">Noor Jehan (born Allah Wasai; 21 September 1926 – 23 December 
                2000; sometimes spelled Noorjehan), also known by her 
                honorific title Malika-e-Tarannum (the queen of melody), 
                was a Pakistani playback singer and actress who worked first 
                in British India and then in Pakistan. Her career spanned more 
                than six decades (1930s–1990s). She was renowned as one of the 
                greatest and most influential singers of all time especially 
                throughout South Asia and was given the honorific title of 
                Malika-e-Tarannum in Pakistan. She had a command of 
                Hindustani classical music as well as other music genres.</br></br>
                Along with Ahmed Rushdi, she holds the record for having given 
                voice to the largest number of film songs in the history of 
                Pakistani cinema. She is estimated to have made more than 40 
                films and sung around 20,000 numbers during a career which lasted
                more than half a century. She is thought to be one of the most 
                prolific singers of all time. She is also considered to be the first 
                female Pakistani film director.</p></br></br>
